# Reconstructing Rotation Curves with Neural Networks

This repository presents a novel approach to reconstructing galaxy rotation curves using neural networks optimized with genetic algorithms. Our methodology employs the DEAP library with our [`nnogada`](https://github.com/igomezv/Nnogada) framework for efficient and effective tuning of neural network hyperparameters.

## Overview

Galaxy rotation curves are critical for understanding the mass distribution within galaxies. Traditional methods of analyzing these curves often involve extensive manual effort. Our project introduces a machine-learning approach to generate rotation curve reconstructions based on the observational data.

## How to Use

1. **Setting Up**: Clone this repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.
    - You can use the .yml file to recreate the anaconda environment:
      
        - ``conda env create -f environment.yml``
        
    - Otherwise, we recommend the following to avoid incompatibilities in some libraries:
        - ``conda create -n neuralrcenv python=3.8``
        - ``conda activate neuralrcenv``
        -  ``conda install numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow==2.12``
        -  ``pip install astroNN``.

    - Finally, if you want to retrain the neural network models with genetic algorithms, please clone or download `nnogada` from [here](https://github.com/igomezv/Nnogada).

3. **Running Models**: Navigate to the `models` directory. Use the provided scripts to load and run predictions using our pre-trained neural networks.
4. **Visualization**: To view the reconstruction plots and loss functions, head to the `figures` directory. Additional scripts are available for generating new plots.



## Repository Contents

- **ALL_RC_mass_models.ipynb** contains the hyperparameter tuning for all the galaxies using `nnogada`. **load_all_models.ipynb** allows to load the `.h5` saved models, trained in the **ALL_RC_mass_models.ipynb** notebook. **RC_neural_model.ipynb** and **RC_mass_models.ipynb** notebooks have preliminary/exploratory tests.

- **models/**: This directory contains binary `.h5` files of all the neural network models we have trained. These models are ready to use for predicting galaxy rotation curves.
  
- **figures/**: Here, you'll find various plots related to the reconstruction of rotation curves and the visualization of loss functions over the training period. These figures illustrate the effectiveness and convergence of our models.

- **data/**: This directory hosts the original observational data of rotational curves from the THINGS survey, kindly provided by Prof. Erwing De Blok.
